### Core Components Detailed Analysis 🔍

#### 1. BofhContractBase
- Base contract implementing core functionality
- Security features and access control
- Event system and state management
- Risk parameter management

Key Design Decisions:
```solidity
abstract contract BofhContractBase {
    SecurityLib.SecurityState internal securityState;
    // ... other state variables
}
```

Rationale:
- Separation of concerns
- Upgradability support
- Clear security boundaries

#### 2. BofhContractV2
- Main implementation contract
- Sequential multi-hop / multi-DEX swap execution (constant product, x·y=k)
- Per-hop fee correctness and owner-managed DEX registry routing
- Price impact validation (per-hop cap via PoolLib.validateSwap)

Architecture Pattern:
```solidity
contract BofhContractV2 is BofhContractBase {
    using MathLib for uint256;
    using PoolLib for PoolLib.PoolState;
    // ... implementation
}
```

Benefits:
- Clear inheritance hierarchy
- Library utilization for specialized functions
- Gas optimization through library usage

#### 3. Library System 📚

##### MathLib
- Mathematical operations (sqrt, cbrt)
- Fixed-point helpers (log2, exp2) used by pool volatility analysis
- Numerical methods (Newton's method)

Design Philosophy:
```solidity
library MathLib {
    // Pure functions for mathematical operations
    // No state modifications
    // Gas-optimized implementations
}
```

##### PoolLib
- Pool state management
- Liquidity analysis
- Price impact calculations

Implementation Strategy:
```solidity
library PoolLib {
    struct PoolState {
        // Comprehensive pool state
    }
    // Pool analysis functions
}
```

##### SecurityLib
- Access control
- Safety checks
- Rate limiting

Security Pattern:
```solidity
library SecurityLib {
    struct SecurityState {
        // Security-related state
    }
    // Security enforcement functions
}
```

    uint64 timestamp;
    uint64 flags;
}
```
